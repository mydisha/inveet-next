## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete service layered pattern for a Laravel wedding invitation application with authentication, authorization, and comprehensive API endpoints.

## What Has Been Implemented

  - Includes soft deletes
  - Has relationships with users, themes, orders, invitations
  - Includes business logic methods (publish, unpublish, mark as draft)
  - Has query scopes for filtering

- **Order Model** (`app/Models/Order.php`)
  - Includes soft deletes
  - Has relationships with users, packages, weddings
  - Includes payment status management
  - Has query scopes for different order states

- **Package Model** (`app/Models/Package.php`)
  - Includes soft deletes
  - Has relationships with orders and themes
  - Includes discount calculation logic
  - Has query scopes for filtering

- **SpecialInvitation Model** (`app/Models/SpecialInvitation.php`)
  - Includes soft deletes
  - Has password protection functionality
  - Includes lock/unlock functionality
  - Has query scopes for filtering

- **Theme Model** (`app/Models/Theme.php`)
  - Has relationships with users, weddings, packages
  - Includes activation/deactivation logic
  - Has query scopes for filtering

### 2. Repository Layer
- **BaseRepositoryInterface** (`app/Repositories/BaseRepositoryInterface.php`)
  - Defines contract for basic CRUD operations
  - Includes methods: all, find, findBy, create, update, delete, paginate

- **BaseRepository** (`app/Repositories/BaseRepository.php`)
  - Concrete implementation of BaseRepositoryInterface
  - Uses Eloquent models for data access
  - Provides common repository functionality

- **Specific Repositories**:
  - UserRepository
  - WeddingRepository
  - OrderRepository
  - PackageRepository
  - SpecialInvitationRepository

### 3. Service Layer
- **BaseServiceInterface** (`app/Services/BaseServiceInterface.php`)
  - Defines contract for service operations
  - Includes methods: getAll, findById, create, update, delete, paginate

- **BaseService** (`app/Services/BaseService.php`)
  - Abstract base class for services
  - Implements common service functionality

- **Specific Services**:
  - UserService (with role management)
  - WeddingService (with slug generation)
  - OrderService (with invoice generation)
  - PackageService (with price calculations)
  - SpecialInvitationService (with password handling)

### 4. Controllers
- **UserController** (`app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`)
  - Full CRUD operations
  - Role management (assign, remove, sync)
  - User activation/deactivation
  - Profile management

- **WeddingController** (`app/Http/Controllers/WeddingController.php`)
  - Full CRUD operations
  - Publishing/unpublishing functionality

  - View count incrementing

- **OrderController** (`app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php`)
  - Full CRUD operations
  - Payment processing
  - Status management
  - Order cancellation

- **PackageController** (`app/Http/Controllers/PackageController.php`)
  - Full CRUD operations
  - Recommendation management
  - Discount management
  - Price calculations

- **SpecialInvitationController** (`app/Http/Controllers/SpecialInvitationController.php`)
  - Full CRUD operations
  - Password management
  - Lock/unlock functionality
  - Bulk creation

### 5. Form Request Validation
- **User Requests**:
  - StoreUserRequest
  - UpdateUserRequest

- **Wedding Requests**:
  - StoreWeddingRequest
  - UpdateWeddingRequest

- **Order Requests**:
  - StoreOrderRequest

- **Package Requests**:
  - StorePackageRequest

- **Special Invitation Requests**:
  - StoreSpecialInvitationRequest

### 6. Authentication & Authorization
- **Laravel Breeze API** installed and configured
- **Laravel Sanctum** for API authentication
- **Spatie Laravel Permission** for role-based access control
- **Custom Middleware** (`CheckRole`) for role verification
- **Role-based Routes**:
  - Public routes (packages, weddings, invitations)
  - Protected routes (user management, wedding management)
  - Admin routes (user management, system management)

### 7. Database & Migrations
- **96 Application Migrations** successfully run
- **Database Schema** includes:
  - Users, weddings, orders, packages, themes
  - Special invitations, comments, galleries
  - Payment systems, wallets, transactions
  - User onboarding, feedback, surveys

### 8. Seeders
- **RolePermissionSeeder**: Creates comprehensive permission system
- **UserSeeder**: Creates users with different roles
- **ThemeSeeder**: Creates sample wedding themes
- **PackageSeeder**: Creates sample wedding packages

### 9. API Routes
- **Comprehensive API endpoints** for all entities
- **Proper middleware** protection
- **Role-based access** control
- **RESTful design** patterns

### 10. Service Provider Configuration
- **AppServiceProvider** configured with:
  - Repository bindings
  - Service bindings
  - Proper dependency injection setup

## Technical Features
