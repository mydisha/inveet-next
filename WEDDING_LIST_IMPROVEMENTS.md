# Wedding List Layout Improvements

## Overview
I've significantly improved the wedding list layout to be more clean, professional, and user-friendly. The new design includes wedding cover images, better organization, and enhanced user interactions.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Wedding Card Component (`WeddingCard.tsx`)
- **Cover Images**: Displays wedding theme preview images with fallback gradients
- **Couple Names**: Prominently displays couple names as the main identifier
- **Location Information**: Shows wedding location/venue with location icon
- **Status Badges**: Clear visual indicators for published, draft, and inactive weddings
- **Rich Information**: Shows wedding date, view count, last updated, and package details
- **Action Buttons**: View and Edit buttons with hover effects
- **Professional Styling**: Modern card design with subtle shadows and animations
- **Brand Colors**: Uses proper rose gold/amber color scheme instead of pink

### 2. Improved MyWeddings Page Layout
- **Enhanced Search**: Real-time search by couple names, location, venue, title, or theme name
- **Status Filtering**: Filter weddings by status (published, draft, inactive)
- **View Modes**: Toggle between grid and list view
- **Results Summary**: Shows filtered results count
- **Empty States**: Helpful empty states with call-to-action buttons
- **Professional Header**: Clean header with create button and search/filter bar
- **Brand Colors**: Consistent rose gold/amber color scheme throughout

### 3. Cover Image Support
The system now supports wedding cover images through the theme relationship:

```typescript
interface Wedding {
  id: number;
  title?: string;
  slug?: string;
  status: 'published' | 'draft' | 'inactive';
  wedding_start?: string;
  wedding_end?: string;
  view_count?: number;
  // Couple information - Most important for identification
  couple_name_1?: string;
  couple_name_2?: string;
  wedding_location?: string;
  wedding_venue?: string;
  theme?: {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    slug: string;
    preview_image?: string; // This is the cover image
  };
  package?: {
    id: number;
    name: string;
  };
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 4. Fallback Gradient System
When no cover image is available, the system uses theme-based gradients with proper brand colors:
- Classic Elegance: Amber to yellow gradient (rose gold theme)
- Modern Minimalist: Gray gradient
- Rustic Charm: Amber to orange gradient
- Tropical Paradise: Green to teal gradient
- Vintage Romance: Purple to indigo gradient
- Bohemian Bliss: Yellow to orange gradient

## Backend Requirements

To fully support the new layout, ensure your wedding data includes:

1. **Couple Information**: Include couple_name_1, couple_name_2, wedding_location, wedding_venue
2. **Theme Relationship**: Load the theme with each wedding
3. **Preview Images**: Add preview_image field to themes table
4. **Status Calculation**: Ensure status is properly calculated based on is_published, is_draft flags
5. **View Count**: Track and return view_count for each wedding

### Example Backend Response

{
  "weddings": [
    {
      "id": 1,

      "updated_at": "2024-01-20T15:30:00Z"
    }

The new `WeddingCard` component can also be reused in other parts of the application where wedding listings are needed.
